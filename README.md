> A server, a domain, a line of code, a minute, and you'll be able to build a domain mailbox of your own.

## [中文文档](./README_CN.md)

I'm Chinese and I'm not good at English, so I apologise for my translation.

## Introduction

PMail is a personal email server that pursues a minimal deployment process and extreme resource consumption. It runs on
a single file and contains complete send/receive mail service and web-side mail management functions. Just a server , a
domain name , a line of code , a minute of deployment time , you will be able to build a domain name mailbox of your
own .

All kinds of PR are welcome, whether you are fixing bugs, adding features, or optimizing translations. Also, call for a
beautiful and cute Logo for this project!

## Features

* Single file operation and easy deployment.

* The binary file is only 15MB and takes up less than 10M of memory during the run.

* Support dkim, spf checksum, [Email Test](https://www.mail-tester.com/) score 10 points if correctly configured.

* Implementing the ACME protocol, the program will automatically obtain and update Let's Encrypt certificates.

> By default, a ssl certificate is generated for the web service, allowing pages to use the https protocol.
> If you have your own gateway or don't need https, set `httpsEnabled` to `2` in the configuration file so that the web
> service will not use https.
(Note: Even if you don't need https, please make sure the path to the ssl certificate file is correct, although the web
> service doesn't use the certificate anymore, the smtp protocol still needs the certificate)

* Support pop3, smtp protocol, you can use any mail client you like.

## Disadvantages

* At present, only the core function of sending and receiving emails has been completed. Basically, it can only be used
  by a single person, and does not deal with issues related to permission management in the process of multiple users.

* The UI is ugly
